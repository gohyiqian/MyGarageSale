## Extending Django User Model:

```python
# models.py
class UserType(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True, editable=False)
    user = models.OneToOneField(User,on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    is_seller = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_buyer = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    bio = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    profile_image = models.ImageField(default='images/noAvatar.png',null=True, blank=True)
    cover_image = models.ImageField(default='images/userCoverImage.jpg',null=True, blank=True)

    @receiver(post_save, sender=User)
    def create_user_type(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
        if created:
            UserType.objects.get_or_create(user=instance)

    @receiver(post_save, sender=User)
    def save_user_type(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        instance.usertype.save()

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.user)
```

```python
# serializers.py
class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    name = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)
    isAdmin = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)
    usertype = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['id', 'username', 'email', 'name', 'isAdmin', 'date_joined', 'usertype']

    # customised default is_staff to isAdmin
    def get_isAdmin(self, obj):
        return obj.is_staff

    #customised usertype to include seller and buyer
    def get_usertype(self,obj):
        usertype = obj.usertype
        serializer = UserTypeSerializer(usertype, many=False)
        return serializer.data

```

## MVP:

The MVP will have the essential features of an ecommerce applications such as:

1. Shop Products by Categories
